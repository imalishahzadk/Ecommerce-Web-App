This project involves creating a feature-rich e-commerce website using PUG, MongoDB, Mongoose, and ExpressJS, following the MVC design pattern. The website includes a homepage with a navigation bar, search and cart facilities, side panel with categories and advertisements, and sections for random products. It also features login functionality with Facebook, Gmail, or account credentials, along with signup capability. Product details, shopping cart management, and user profiles/history are also implemented, aiming for a comprehensive user experience akin to popular e-commerce platforms like Daraz.
